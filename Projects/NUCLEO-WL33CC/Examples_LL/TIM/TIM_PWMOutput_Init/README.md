## <b>TIM_PWMOutput_Init Example Description</b>

Use of a timer peripheral to generate a 
PWM output signal and update the PWM duty cycle. This example is based on the 
STM32Wl3x TIM LL API. The peripheral initialization uses 
LL initialization function to demonstrate LL Init.

In this example TIM2 input clock TIM2CLK is set to APB0 clock (PCLK1),
since APB0 pre-scaler is equal to 1.

    TIM2CLK = PCLK1
	
    PCLK1 = HCLK
	
    => TIM2CLK = HCLK = SystemCoreClock (64 MHz)

To set the TIM2 counter clock frequency to 10 KHz, the pre-scaler (PSC) is
calculated as follows:

	PSC = (TIM2CLK / TIM2 counter clock) - 1
	PSC = ((SystemCoreClock/1) /10 KHz) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 64Mhz for STM32wl3x Devices.

Auto-reload (ARR) is calculated to get a time base period of 10 ms,
meaning a time base frequency of 100 Hz.

	ARR = (TIM2 counter clock / time base frequency) - 1
	ARR = (TIM2 counter clock / 100) - 1

Initially, the capture/compare register (CCR1) of the output channel is set to
half the auto-reload value meaning a initial duty cycle of 50%.
Generally speaking this duty cycle is calculated as follows:

	Duty cycle = (CCR1 / ARR) * 100

The timer output channel must be connected to TIM2_CH1 on board NUCLEO-WL33CC.
Thus TIM2_CH1 status (on/off) mirrors the timer output level (active v.s. inactive).

USER push-button can be used to change the duty cycle from 0% up to 100% by
steps of 10%. Duty cycle is periodically measured. It can be observed through
the debugger by watching the variable uwMeasuredDutyCycle.

Initially the output channel is configured in output compare toggle mode.
