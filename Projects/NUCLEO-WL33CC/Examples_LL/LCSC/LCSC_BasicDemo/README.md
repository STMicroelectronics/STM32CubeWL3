## <b>LCSC_BasicDemo Example Description</b>

How to use an LC sensor controller (LCSC) peripheral to measure rotation of wheel.

This example is based on the STM32WL3x LCSC HAL API.

Example configuration:

The LCSC control the COMP, DAC, VCMBUFF and PB1, PA14, PB2 in order to implement the LCSC feature.

This example is configured to count the number of wheel rotations in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions
with LCA and LCB.

When the tamper (LCT) detection is activated, it is possible to detect if a metallic surface has interfered with the measurement of the number of revolutions.

Example execution:

This example can be divided in the following parts:

 - initialization of the LCSC IP.

 - initial calibration of the LCSC (for this step the coils must not be exposed to the metal part).

 - infinite while loop, and the LCSC working on its own.
   The wheel can be placed in front of the coils only after the initial calibration, and can eventually start rotating.
   When the wheel performs a number of rotations, clockwise or anticlockwise, equal to the threshold defined in the proper register.
   A message is printed at the terminal.

Connection needed:

Hardware used for the LC network in this example :

  Inductances: La, Lb and Lt = 470uF (Murata 11R474C)

  Capacitors: Ca, Cb and Ct = 560pF Cext_LCSC = 470nF

Note: The configuration of the LCSC must be updated based on the inductors and capacitors used.
