## <b>CORTEX_MPU Example Description</b>

Presentation of the MPU features. This example configures MPU attributes of different
MPU regions then configures a memory area as privileged read-only, and attempts to
perform read and write operations in different modes.

If the access is permitted LD1 is toggling. If the access is not permitted,
a memory management fault is generated and LD1 is ON.

To generate an MPU memory fault exception due to an access right error, press
user button.

#### <b>Notes</b>

1. Using STM32CubeIDE debugger, when hard fault is generated user shall press the debugger "Run" button to continue the execution
