## <b>MRSUBG_Sequencer_Sniff Example Description</b>

This example shows how to set the Sequencer to operate in sniff mode. This example demonstrates the receiver side and requires another device as a TX. 
Moreover, a Virtual Com stream is open. The receiver will write its own buffer on video every time a reception is performed.
