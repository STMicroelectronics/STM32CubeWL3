### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on NUCLEO-WL33CCx application board.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-WL33CCx application board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.  

### <b>How to use it ?</b> 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

 - Open the project with your preferred toolchain
 - Customize the project for implementing the user specific demonstration scenario using the sub-1 GHz radio proprietary driver
 - Rebuild all files and flash the board with the executable file
