## <b>MRSUBG_WakeupRadio_Tx Example Description</b>

This example explains shows how to set the SoC in deepstop and configure the MRSUBG to wakeup the SOC pressing PB2 to send a frame.  
This example demonstrates the transmitter side and requires another device as a LPAWUR receiver. The receiver example is located under the NUCLEO-WL33CC\Demonstrations\LPAWUR\LPAWUR_WakeupRadio_Rx folder.
Moreover, a Virtual Com stream is open. Both the transmitter and the receiver will write their own buffer on video every time a transmission or a reception is performed.
