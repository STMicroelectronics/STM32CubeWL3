## <b>LPAWUR_WakeupRadio_Rx Example Description</b>

This example explains shows how to set the SoC in deepstop and configure the LPAWUR to wakeup the SOC when a frame arrives and it is correctly receveid. This example demonstrates the receiver side and requires another device as a transmitter. The transmitter example is located under the NUCLEO-WL33CC1\Demonstrations\MRSUBG\MRSUBG_WakeupRadio_Tx folder.
Moreover, a Virtual Com stream is open. Both the transmitter and the receiver will write their own buffer on video every time a transmission or a reception is performed.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on NUCLEO-WL33CCx application board.

  - For the receiver part: since the RF path of LPAWUR is not connected to the SMA connector, to run this example is need to solder a 0 Ohm resistor on C3. The matching network is assembled and is it tuned for the band 826-958 MHz.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-WL33CCx application board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.  

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

 - Open your preferred toolchain and import the .c files in your workspace
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
