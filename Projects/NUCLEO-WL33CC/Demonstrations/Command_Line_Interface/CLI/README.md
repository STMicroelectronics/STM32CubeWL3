## <b>CLI Example Description</b>

The STM32WL3 CLI demo application allows to use the STM32WL3 WiSE-RadioExplorer PC application by simply connecting a STM32WL3 development kit to PC USB port.

Moreover a Virtual Com stream is open. Both the transmitter and the receiver will write their own buffer on video every time a transmission or a reception is performed.
