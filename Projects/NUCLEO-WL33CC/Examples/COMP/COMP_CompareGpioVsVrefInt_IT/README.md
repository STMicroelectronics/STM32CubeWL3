## <b>COMP_CompareGpioVsVrefInt_IT Example Description</b>

How to use a comparator peripheral to compare a voltage level applied on
a GPIO pin to the internal voltage reference (VrefInt), in interrupt mode.
This example is based on the STM32WL3x COMP HAL API.

Example configuration:

Comparator instance COMP1 is configured to compare:

- input plus set to a GPIO pin (cf pin below) in analog mode.

- input minus set to 3.3V.
  
Comparator interruption is enabled with trigger edge set to
both edges rising and falling.

Example execution

From the main program execution, comparator is enabled.
Each time the voltage level applied on GPIO pin (comparator input plus) 
is crossing VrefInt voltage threshold (comparator input minus),
the comparator generates an interruption.

LD1 is used to monitor program execution status:

- Normal operation:

  - LED turned on if comparator voltage level on input plus is higher than input minus
  
  - LED turned off if comparator voltage level on input plus is lower than input minus
  
- Error: LED remaining turned on

Connection needed:

Use an external power supply to generate a voltage in range [0V; 3.3V]
and connect it to analog input pin (cf pin below).

Note: If no power supply available, this pin can be let floating (in this case
      comparator output state will be undetermined).
	  
Other peripherals used:

  1 GPIO for LD1
  
  1 GPIO for analog input: pin PB.01 (Arduino connector CN7 pin 2 A1, Morpho connector CN3 pin 30)
  
#### <b>Notes</b> 

-The COMP negative input can use an internal generated voltage. This voltage is generated as a fraction of the battery voltage instead of 1.2 V internal voltage.This causes the internal COMP generated voltage to be battery-level dependent (refer to device Errata sheet).
