## <b>MRSUBG_802_15_4_Tx Example Description</b>

This is a demo implementation of the standard 802.15.4 protocol.  
It takes in account the physical defined by the standard. The example shows how to configure the packets in order to transmit or receive 802.15.4 packets.

A Virtual COM stream is open. Both the transmitter and the receiver will write their buffers on video every time a Tx or an Rx is performed.
