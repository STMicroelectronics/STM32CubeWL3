## <b>RCC_LSEConfig Example Description</b>

Enabling/disabling of the low-speed external(LSE) RC oscillator (about 32 KHz) at run time, using the RCC HAL API.

   - Board: NUCLEO-WL33CC (embeds a STM32WL33CCVx device)
   - Microcontroller Clock Output LCO Pin: PA.04  (Arduino connector CN8 pin 8 D7, Morpho connector CN4 pin 23)

In this example, after startup SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using
PLL as clock source, the USER push-button (connected to B1)
is used to enable/disable LSE:

Each time the USER push-button is pressed, B1 interrupt is generated and the ISR
enables the LSE when it is off, disables it when it is on.

- when LSE is off, LD1 is toggling (every 300 ms)
- when LSE is on, LD2 is toggling (every 300 ms)

LSE clock waveform is available on the LCO pin PA.04 and can be captured
on an oscilloscope.


In case of configuration error, LD3 is On.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32WL33CCVx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-WL33CC
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.
