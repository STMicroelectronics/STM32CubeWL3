## <b>RCC_LSIConfig Example Description</b>

How to enable/disable the low-speed internal (LSI) RC oscillator (about 32 KHz) at run time, using the RCC HAL API.

   - Board: NUCLEO-WL33CC (embeds a STM32WL33CCVx device)
   - Microcontroller Clock Output LCO Pin: PA.04 (Arduino connector CN8 pin 8 D7, Morpho connector CN4 pin 23)

In this example, after startup SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using the HSE with
PLL as clock source, the USER push-button (connected to B1)
is used to enable/disable LSI:

Each time the USER push-button is pressed, B1 interrupt is generated and the ISR
enables the LSI when it is off, disables it when it is on.

LD1 behaviour is as follows according to LSI activation:

- when LSI is on, LD1 is toggling (every 100 ms).
- when LSI is off, LD1 is on.

LSI clock waveform is available on the LCO pin PA.04 and can be captured
on an oscilloscope.

In case of configuration error, LD3 is on.


#### <b>Notes</b>

1.  Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

2.  The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
